## Hi there!
Im Dru. I'm a 16 y/o programmer-in-training hoping to make some great games! 
This repository will just be there to showcase little projects I made here or there, or updates on what I've learned!

## Some fun facts about me:
1. I love animals, especially my cats.
2. My very first game was a simple boulder dodge game made using JavaScript!
3. I'm only 16, but ive already graduated and am attending college! Woohoo!

Well, thats about it for now. I may add some little updates later!
